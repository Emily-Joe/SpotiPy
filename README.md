# SpotiPy
SpotiPy is a script for tracking the rotation of active regions (mainly sunspots) on the Sun. It uses SDO-data, downloads continuum data in the time-frame of a sunspot (or active region), tracks the differential rotation of the region based on the starting position and calculate the rotation rate and intensity cuves (CLV and limb-darkening).
